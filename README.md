Build simple classes for the following objects
. Car
. Product
. Store

The Car class can have any car attributes

The Product class should have attributes of a product i.e (the product, quantity of the product in stock, price of the product). A car is a product of the store, but there can be other products so the attribute of the car can be promoted to the Product. The Product class should have methods to display a product, and a method to display the status of a product if it is still in stock or not.

The Store class should have attributes like

.Number of products in the store that are still up for sale
.Adding an Item to the store
.Listing all product items in the store
.Sell an item
.Show a list of sold items and the total price
